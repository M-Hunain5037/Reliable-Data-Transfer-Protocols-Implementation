# Reliable Data Transfer Protocols Implementation

## Overview

This project implements three reliable data transfer protocols:
1. **Stop-and-Wait (rdt 3.0)**
2. **Go-Back-N (GBN)**
3. **Selective Repeat (SR)**

The implementation simulates a uni-directional data transfer over an unreliable network, handling packet loss, corruption, and delays.

---

## Features

- **Stop-and-Wait (rdt 3.0)**: Sends one packet at a time and waits for an acknowledgment (ACK).
- **Go-Back-N (GBN)**: Maintains a sliding window of packets and retransmits all packets in the window on timeout.
- **Selective Repeat (SR)**: Maintains a sliding window and retransmits only lost or corrupted packets.

---

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- No additional libraries are required.

---

## How to Run

1. Clone or download the project to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd "path\to\project\directory"
   ```
3. Run the program using the following command:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
   
   The program will execute all three protocols (Stop-and-Wait, Go-Back-N, and Selective Repeat) sequentially.
   
4. Observe the output in the console, which will display the behavior of each protocol, including packet transmissions, acknowledgments, and error handling.

---

## Configurable Parameters

You can modify the following parameters in the `main.py` file to test different scenarios:

- **PROB_CORRUPTION**: Probability of packet corruption (default: `0.1`).
- **PROB_LOSS**: Probability of packet loss (default: `0.1`).
- **PROB_DELAY**: Probability of packet delay (default: `0.1`).
- **MAX_DELAY**: Maximum delay for packets (default: `0.5 seconds`).
- **TIMEOUT_DURATION**: Timeout duration for retransmissions (default: `1.0 seconds`).
- **WINDOW_SIZE**: Window size for Go-Back-N and Selective Repeat protocols (default: `4`).
- **TOTAL_PACKETS**: Total number of packets to be sent (default: `10`).

---

## Output

The program will display the following for each protocol:

- Packet transmissions and retransmissions.
- ACKs received or lost.
- Handling of corrupted or delayed packets.
- Final data received by the receiver.

Example Output:

**Starting Stop-and-Wait Protocol**  
```
[Sender] Sending <Packet type=DATA, seq=0, checksum=123, payload=DATA_0>
[Receiver] Received <Packet type=DATA, seq=0, checksum=123, payload=DATA_0>
[Receiver] Accepted packet 0
[Sender] ACK received: <Packet type=ACK, seq=0, checksum=45, payload=None>
...
```

**Starting Go-Back-N Protocol**  
```
[Sender] Sending <Packet type=DATA, seq=0, checksum=123, payload=DATA_0>
[Sender] Sending <Packet type=DATA, seq=1, checksum=124, payload=DATA_1>
...
```

**Starting Selective Repeat Protocol**  
```
[Sender] Sending <Packet type=DATA, seq=0, checksum=123, payload=DATA_0>
[Receiver] Received <Packet type=DATA, seq=0, checksum=123, payload=DATA_0>
...
```

## Notes

- Ensure that **Python** is installed and added to your system's **PATH**.
- Modify the configurable parameters to test different scenarios, such as higher packet loss or corruption probabilities.
